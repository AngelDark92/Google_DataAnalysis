# Case Study from Google Data Analysis Program

This is the case study 2 from the google data analysis program on Coursera. It includes every step for a successful data analysis: Ask (to identify the business task), Prepare (the data to analyse and verify it), Process (filter and check data for errors), Analyze, Share (visualizations and presentation of the findings), Act (recommendations for the company).

## Company Background: Ballbeat 
Urška Sršen and Sando Mur founded Bellabeat, a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products.
Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.
